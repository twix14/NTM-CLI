## Getting Started
To run the main script you need to have [AutoIt-v3](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/) installed 

Clone this repository and run the main script with the arguments needed for a new scan. You can see the arguments needed by just running 
`ruby main.rb` any argument between brackets is optional, although to run a scan you need at least one source of information between, 
free-form IPs, IP ranges or Subnets.
